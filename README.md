# 🎤 AI Karaoke Project

An interactive, console-based karaoke experience powered by Python. This project fetches lyrics using the Genius API and downloads karaoke tracks from YouTube using `yt-dlp`. It then displays real-time lyric highlighting in sync with the music, offering a fun and engaging solo karaoke experience.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Automatic lyrics fetching using Genius API
- 🎵 Karaoke track download from YouTube via `yt-dlp`
- ⏱️ Time-synced lyrics based on song duration
- 🎨 Real-time lyric highlighting (current line: bright green, others: yellow)
- 📼 Console clearing for a clean karaoke-style experience
- 💻 Cross-platform compatible (Windows/Linux/Mac)

## 🧠 AI Component

This project demonstrates a **basic level of AI integration** through:

- **Intelligent lyric parsing** using NLP-like filtering to clean up non-singing parts like `[Chorus]`, `[Verse]`, etc.
- **Synchronized timing logic**, where lyric display is mapped proportionally across the total audio duration.
- While no deep learning model is used, the real-time behavior mimics human timing and enhances interactivity using simple automation and logic.
